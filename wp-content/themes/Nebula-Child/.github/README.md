# Nebula Child Theme
This is the child theme for the [Nebula WordPress Theme](https://gearside.com/nebula/?utm_campaign=documentation&utm_medium=child+readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=nebula+theme).

### Requirements
You'll need to [download and install the parent theme](https://github.com/chrisblakley/Nebula) for this child theme to work (and, of course, you'll need [WordPress itself](https://wordpress.org/download/))!

Once installed, you can run the initialization process which will activate this child theme automatically! See the [installation instructions](https://github.com/chrisblakley/Nebula#installation) on the parent theme repo.

### Documentation
After everything is set up you can use the [documentation website](https://gearside.com/nebula/?utm_campaign=documentation&utm_medium=child+readme&utm_source=github&utm_content=full+documentation) to begin developing and customizing your theme!
