# Security Policy

Nebula does not, and will not, store any personally identifiable information, proprietary information, or any user-oriented data at all for that matter. Proper sanitization and best practices are used for database interactions (E.g. using WPDB functions) to prevent exploitation. However, security concerns are treated with priority support if any unintended access is discovered.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of Nebula is officially supported. As bugs and issues are resolved, an update will be committed which becomes available for automated updates remotely or manually. Please be careful when updating parent themes in WordPress as breaking changes may have been introduced as features are created and functionality is improved.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Minor issues [can be reported on the Github repository](https://github.com/chrisblakley/Nebula/issues) and if for whatever reason some kind of major security concern arises, please [reach out to me personally](https://github.com/chrisblakley). In either case, please provide as much detail as possible including reproduction steps and screenshots! I cannot promise an individual response, but any issues will be taken seriously and in an appropriate amount of time.

Please note that Nebula is provided â€‹as-is and I make no other warranties, express or implied, and hereby disclaims all implied warranties, including any warranty of merchantability and warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
