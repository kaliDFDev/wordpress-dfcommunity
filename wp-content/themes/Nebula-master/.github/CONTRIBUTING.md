# Contributing to Nebula

Thank you for your interest in Nebula! We want this WordPress theme framework be as easy and intuitive as possible for developers of all skill levels. To maintain that level of prudence, we are [somewhat particular about code style](https://gearside.com/nebula/manifesto/?utm_campaign=documentation&utm_medium=contributing&utm_source=github&utm_content=code+style). 

## Conventions
Nebula has some writing styles that may be unique or atypical from other projects. These include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Tab indents.
* There is no limit to line length.
* Conditionals __always__ use `{` and `}` brackets.
* Conditionals should have a space inside of the `(` and `){` which wrap the condition(s).
* Opening `{` brackets always appear on the same line as the conditional or function call.
* CSS (Sass) properties are all written on a single line for each selector; each selector should be on its own line.
* PHP variables are underscored `$example_variable`, JavaScript variables are camel-cased `exampleVariable`.
* Nebula supports the last 2 versions of browsers with >1% market share.
* Features should not require additional server installations.
