## Valid Hostnames

Filter Type: Custom

Filter Type: Custom

Exclude, Language Settings

`.{15,}|\s[^\s]*\s|\.|,|\!|\/|0`

# Other Filters

These are filters that may be useful in certain cases, but aren't applicable to all websites.

## Insignificant Browser Sizes

Exclude traffic whose browser size is less than 100px in either dimension.

Filter Type: Custom

Exclude, Browser Size

`^(\d{1,2})x(\d{1,2})$`

## Lowercase URIs

Converting URIs to lowercase prevents a page's data from being split if a user enters a URL with capital letters.

*Note: This is now handled by Google Autotrack in Nebula.*

Filter Type: Custom

Lowercase, Filter Field: Request URI
